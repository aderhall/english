# Language:
## An uncreatively named english language generator
Basically, I've been experimenting with recursive transition networks (RTNs) and have decided to make a python script that makes grammatically valid english sentences. There are (surprisingly) a few uses for this. For instance, if you wanted a supervised learning AI that speaks english but don't want to start at the beginning (ie. stringing letters together and telling it if it makes sense) or want a bot to communicate its findings to you in a humanlike manner, you may require something that makes english.

## Dependencies:
1. Python (with standard pre-included modules)
2. A computer

Yeah, not huge on massive libraries.
## How to use:
Hold python in one hand and the script in the other and sorta... mash them together?
Or for \*nix, OSX...
```bash
$ cd ~/path/to/folder/language/
$ python language.py <options>
....rainbow$....
```
Options:
+ speak: say text out loud (OSX only right now)
+ converse: try to have a 'conversation'
+ verbose: display debug information
## Creative modifications!
In the code, you can specify allowed nouns/verbs/adjectives/articles/prepositiwhatsits...

It's kinda obvious where those are.
Otherwise I have no comments (sorry, sorry!) so probably best to leave the rest alone (but you don't need to)
Just remember if you break stuff by messing with the code, don't expect the programming gods to have mercy.
## What you can and can't do:
Can: use, modify, abuse, disgrace your computer by forcing it to run your modifications.

Can't: copy paste and say you made it (I probably won't care or anything unless you sell it for a million bucks and don't give me any).
